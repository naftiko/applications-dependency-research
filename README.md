# Applications
I want to be capable of understanding the overlap between five separate standards for defining the development, delivery, and operations of applications using common open-source and commercial infrastructure. 

## Specifications
These are the five application specifications being evaluated as part of this research and assessment, but we may be adding more.

- [Cloud Native Application Bundle](https://cnab.io/)
- [Open Component Model](https://ocm.software/)
- [Open Resource Discovery](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/)
- [Radius](https://www.cncf.io/projects/radius/)
- [Score](https://www.cncf.io/projects/score/)

To breakdown these specifications I am exploding the [JSON Schema](schema/) for each spec and producing [APIs.json indexes](index/) of their operations.

## Cloud Native Application Bundle
Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB) are a package format specification that describes a technology for bundling, installing, and managing distributed applications, that are by design, cloud agnostic.

## Open Component Model
The Open Component Model (OCM) is an open standard that enables teams to describe software artifacts and their lifecycle metadata in a consistent, technology-agnostic way. It’s built to support secure, reliable delivery and deployment of software—across cloud, on-prem, hybrid, and even air-gapped environments.

### Specification Properties
I wanted to flatten and understand all the properties of the Score specification.

```
Annotations, Apis, Args, Arrays, Binaries, Booleans, Classes, Commands, Containers, Contents, Cpus, Execs, Expands, Files, Gets, Headers, Hosts, Https, IDs, Images, Integers, Limits, Livenesses, Memories, Metadatas, Modes, Names, Nos, Objects, Ofs, Ones, Params, Paths, Ports, Probes, Protocols, Readinesses, Reads, Onlies, Refs, Requests, Resources, Schemes, Services, Sources, Strings, Targets, Types, Unknowns, Values, Variables, Versions, Volumes
```

## Summary
Across these five specifications I have begun to aggregate the operational and specification specific properties to better understand the common and overlapping aspects of what these specifications do and how they are managed.

### Specification Priorities
These are priorities aggregated across the specifications, identifying the important parts they share within the specifications themselves.

```
Annotations, APIs, Arguments, Bases, Bundles, Callbacks, Commands, Components, Configurations, Containers, Content, Context, Credentials, Custom, Data, Defaults, Definitions, Dependencies, Descriptions, Destinations, Digests, Directions, Encodings, Environments, Extensions, File systems, Formats, Generics, Groups, Headers, Hosts, Identifiers, Identities, Images, Inputs, Instances, Keys, Labels, Mappings, Maximums, Media, Metadata, Minimums, Multiples, Namespaces, Outputs, Parameters, Paths, Policies, Ports, Probes, Properties, Protocols, Providers, Readiness, Reads, References, References, Relations, Requests, Resources, Results, Runtimes, Schemes, Schemas, Selectors, Services, Sizes, Sources, Specifications, Statuses, Systems, Tags, Targets, Titles, Types, Updates, Variables, Versions, Volumes
```

This provides a top-level vocabulary that could be further used to begin working schema, mapping objects and properties, as well as helping inform a new schema work.

### Operational Priorities
These are the operational properties aggregated across all of the specifications, helping understand what is available in aggregate and may be helping drive adoption, or may also contribute to a lack of adoption when missing.

```
Adopters, API, Blog, Change Log, CLI, CNCF Project, Code of Conduct, Community, Community Meetings, Concepts, Contributing, Contributing Using Gen AI, Default Version, Dev Version, Discord, Documentation, Ecosystem, Emails, Examples, Extensions, FAQ, Getting Started, GitHub Organization, GitHub Repository/Repo, Governance, Guides, Help, Implementations, JSON Schema, License, Linting, Logos, Mailing List, Meeting Notes, OpenAPI, Platform Engineering, Policy Levels, Press, Recipes, Registries, Road Map, Samples, Schema, Security, Slack Channel, Specification, Steering Committee, Threads, Tools, Trademark, Tutorials, Use Cases, Videos, VSCode, Website, YouTube
```

This provides a common vocabulary to describe how these projects are operating and investing in their communities, which can be more evenly applied across the specifications as well as any new ones created to augment.

## Next Steps
This work is ongoing, with additional steps needed to better understand what is happening across these specifications, and better understand what the incentives are for this research.

- **Examples** - Need to publish examples for each of the specifications, ideally multiple examples to help understand the implicit or explicit nature of each schema.
- **Adoption** - Quantity the adoption of each standard in some common way to understand where it is used and applied as part of regular enterprise operations.
- **Governance** - I still do not have a common way of expressing what the governance models is behind each of these to understand how decisioins are made on road map.
- **Schema** - Individual schema could be organized and compared on the individual property level to understand the applies to oranges comparison of each object.
- **Mappings** - One could map individual objects and properties across the schema to be able to potentially translate across them.

I am going to just sit on this over the holidays, gather more feedback, and think about other ways that I can work to connect the dots here and inform existing activities across the specs or inform any new spec work.

## Questions
I have questions along the way. I do not intimately know each of the specs as well as fully grasp the space and tooling in which they are applied. I have a pretty good understanding of what is going on, but still have questions.

- Do we intend to create a new spec?
- Would a new spec reference existing?
- Would a new spec intend to replace?
- Is interoperability the goal of this work?
- Should we actively reach out to each spec?
- Who else should we include in this research.
- Who should we interview about this work?

I will be creating issues for some of these questions, but feel free to start them or ask any new questions via issues or pull requests--this is an open converstionf or anyone who wants to get involved and contribute.
